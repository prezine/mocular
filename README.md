Mocular brings to live your creative design on it's board combining awesome technology and framework to make out of your design, a fully fledge iOS or Android App. 

With Mocular, you worry about your design and we use cutting edge technology to build an App on your creative sketch with full controls and have full access to the native hardware.

- **Unlock your creativity.** Mocular makes it painless to create interactive UIs, from shapes, icons, and even more advance stuff like charts and gradients and even more.
- **Atom-Based.** Each build is made of tiny atomic component putted together to make a whole (Molecular, uhmm) Mocular.
- **Collaborative.** Using Kanban technology one or more designer can share a board, and see changes in split seconds. Changes to board takes place without live reloads.
- **Portability.** in the end, what's the size of your App, we care about that too.

Mocular is developerd and supported by CirclepandaLabs and individual core contributors.
